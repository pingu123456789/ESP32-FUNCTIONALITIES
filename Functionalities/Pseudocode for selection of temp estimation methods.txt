B.2.2.10. Pseudocode for implementing method 1 or method 2 based on user configuration towards temperature estimation

Program Begin
Initialize state matrices and parameters for both methods

Loop Forever:
    Read temperature data from all sensors
    Store sensor readings in respective sensor data arrays
    
    If the number of sensor readings reaches WINDOW_SIZE then
        Use Method 1 (Multidimensional Kalman Filter) on the sensor readings:
            Perform Time Update
            Perform Measurement Update
        Print results and memory usage of Method 1

        Use Method 2 (Inferring Regression Parameters and Kalman Filtering) on the sensor readings:
            Perform Time Update
            Perform Measurement Update
        Print results and memory usage of Method 2

        Clear sensor data arrays

    Delay for some time
Loop End

Program End
