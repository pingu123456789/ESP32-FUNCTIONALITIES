B.2.2.4. Data encryption
1. Include necessary libraries for handling DHT sensor, AES encryption, and I2C communication.

2. Define the pin where the DHT sensor is connected, block size for AES encryption and the key size.

3. Create a DHT sensor object and an AES object.

4. Define encryption key and initialization vector (IV).

5. Setup:
    a. Initialize serial communication at 115200 baud rate.
    b. Initialize DHT sensor.
    c. Set the encryption key for AES.

6. Loop:
    a. Read temperature and humidity from the DHT sensor.
    b. Print temperature and humidity values.
    c. Prepare plaintext for encryption by copying the temperature and humidity values into it.
    d. Encrypt the plaintext using AES in CBC mode, outputting the result to ciphertext.
    e. Print the encrypted data in hexadecimal format.
    f. Wait for 1 second before the next loop iteration.
