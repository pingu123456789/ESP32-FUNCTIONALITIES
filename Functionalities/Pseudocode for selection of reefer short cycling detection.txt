B.2.2.11. Pseudocode for implementing method 1 or method 2 based on user configuration towards refrigeration short cycling detection
Initialize common variables

Calculate the process mean of the sensor measurements

Select Method 1 or Method 2 based on user choice

if Method 1 selected:
  Initialize model-specific parameters for Method 1
  Repeat until change point detected or stopping criteria met:
    Calculate the instantaneous log-likelihood ratio
    Update the decision function based on calculated ratio
    Check conditions for change point detection
  
if Method 2 selected:
  Initialize model-specific parameters for Method 2
  Repeat until change point detected or stopping criteria met:
    Calculate the instantaneous log-likelihood ratio
    Update the decision function based on calculated ratio
    Update the drift components and the weight parameter
    Check conditions for change point detection
    If change point detected:
      Determine the starting and ending indexes of the change point
      Implement Recursive Index Shifting for next iteration
    Else:
      Continue with the next data point or iteration
EndIf
